# BuildingConduit

Conduit is a Medium.com clone. It was built to teach students on [Thinkster](http://www.thinkster.io) to build Real World apps using Angular2, and its prerequisite tecnologies like ES6, TypeScript, and RxJS. 

Conduit is a fully featured social blogging site including:

* Authentication with JWT
* Profiles with images
* Write/edit/read articles
* Comments on articles
* Ability to "favorite" articles
* Ability to follow other users & have their articles show up in your feed

[You can view the live demo here.](https://angular2.realworld.io/) This tutorial is still in development and we hope to have to complete rather soon! 

## Development server
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
